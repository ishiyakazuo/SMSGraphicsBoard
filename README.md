# SMSGraphicsBoard by IshiyaKazuo
The goal of this project is to make a reproduction of the Graphics Board v2.0 for the Sega Master System.
The Graphics Board was never released, and the hardware is relatively simple.  It consists of:
- A resistive touch panel
- 3 buttons
- Logic to retrieve the user input from the touch panel and buttons and send them to the console via the controller port.
